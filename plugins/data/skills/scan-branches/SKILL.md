description: Compare two git branches. Summarizes differences and flags concerns (bugs, security, style, inconsistencies).
---

The user wants to compare two git branches.

## Parse arguments

- If **one** branch name is provided, use the current branch (`git branch --show-current`) as the **base** and the provided branch as the **compare** branch.
- If **two** branch names are provided, the first is the **base** and the second is the **compare** branch.
- If no branch name is provided, ask the user which branch to compare against.

## Validate

Confirm both branches exist using `git rev-parse --verify <branch>`. If either branch does not exist, tell the user and stop.

## Gather the diff

Run both of the following:

```
git log --oneline <base>...<compare>
git diff <base>...<compare>
```

This uses the three-dot (merge-base) form, which shows changes on the compare branch since it diverged from the base.

## Handle large diffs

If the diff output is very large, do not attempt to review every line. Instead, focus on a high-level summary: which files changed, what kinds of changes were made (new features, refactors, deletions, config changes, etc.), and call out only the most important concerns.

## Summarize

Review the differences between the two branches. Summarize the changes and flag any concerns (bugs, security, style, inconsistencies). Be concise.
